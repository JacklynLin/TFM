This repository is part of my Master's thesis for the Master's in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Year 2024-2025.

The research aims to evaluate the impact of the Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY) policy on groundwater electrical conductivity, a key indicator of water quality in the Indian state of Haryana.
The study combines traditional causal inference methods (such as Difference-in-Differences, DiD) with more advanced structural modeling approaches (such as Synthetic Difference-in-Differences, SDID, and Bayesian Structural Time Series, BSTS) to provide a robust, multi-perspective evaluation of the policy's impact.

This repository is centered around a single integrated script, TFM_final.Rmd, which includes the entire data processing and modeling workflow. The script is divided into the following four parts:
1. Data Processing
2. Difference-in-Differences Model (DiD)
3. Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID)
4. Bayesian Structural Time Series Model (BSTS)
